Assessing user needs involved engaging with customers to gather their feedback. From this valuable input, I created user stories that served as a foundation for introducing new features and implementing necessary fixes in the application. Crafting user stories aids in task allocation and setting priorities within the team, which greatly contributes to maintaining order, clarity, and adhering to our project completion schedule. When it comes to the development phases of an application, I am inclined to embrace the agile methodology. It offers a structured and efficient approach, as opposed to a hasty and brute force strategy of diving directly into coding. I also plan to leverage the use of milestones and task management on GitHub, particularly for intricate and substantial projects. These tools enhance project organization and tracking. In terms of being an effective team member, I believe it's important to possess certain qualities, such as accountability, discipline, the ability to accept constructive criticism, and adaptability. These attributes are key to fostering a productive and collaborative team environment.
